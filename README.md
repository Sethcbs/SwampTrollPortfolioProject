# SwampTrollPortfolioProject
My First Portfolio Project showcases my capabilities in writing game functionalities such as a cool down timer on attacks, a third-person camera controller, animations, hitboxes, health systems, and raycasting. This project showcases a movement system using horizontal and vertical axis to determine movement direction and handle rotation while using a third-person camera with the Cinemachine add-on. It also uses assets from infinityPBR, where I used animations to bring life to some of the actions I implemented, such as jumping, walking, and attacking. There is also a health system used to determine when the plant monsters get killed, and there is a scoring system that keeps track of currently active enemies. The Raycast system I use allows the player to pick up and throw a rock that the player can use to kill enemies.
