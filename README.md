# SwampTrollPortfolioProject
  My First Portfolio Project showcasing my cababilities in writing game functionalities such as a cool down timer on attacks, a third person camera controller, using animations, hitboxes, health systems, and raycasting.      This project showcases a movement system using horizontal and vertical axis to determine movement direction and handle rotation while using a third person camera with the cinemachine add on. It also uses assets from infinityPBR where I used animations to bring life to some of the actions I implemented such as jumping, walking, and attacking. There is also a health system that is used to determine when the plant monsters are killed and there is a score system that keeps track of currently active enemies. The Raycast system I use is to allow the player to pick up and throw a rock that can be used to kill enemies.
